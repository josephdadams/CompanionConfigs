# CompanionConfigs

These are some configs for Conpanion that I have made that you can readily import into your setup.

# pincode.companionconfig.yaml
This is designed for the Stream Deck +. It supports 4 PIN codes by default but you can add more. You can use each encoder to set the pin position value. Rotating left decreases the number and if it hits 0, it will cycle back to 9 using an expression. Rotating right increases and sets back to 0 if you pass 9. This config supports 4 PIN codes but it can support any number of pin codes you like. All the pin codes are variables, and the pages it would "unlock" to are also variables.
